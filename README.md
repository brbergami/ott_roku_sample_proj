OTT Roku SceneGraph Demo Project
================================

This project was built based on a challenge idea from a company that contacted me.
I brought the simple concept to this open project for several reasons:
1. Because I wanted to. It was on my TO DO list for so long.
2. To link to my In profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunobergami/
3. For the folks out there reading old docs and trying to get into this weird Roku world.
4. To be open to suggestions and keep improving my skills.

Regarding this project
----------------------
Consider this an always WIP.
The intention is to build a simple Over The Top channel which can stream video samples. It's visually not that appealing right now, but I promess I'll be on that as soon as I get it fully functional ;)
I'll bring all the concepts and practices I know and try to KISS, including:
1. Events and observers.
2. Conventions.
3. Port listening.
4. Threading.
5. Custom components (aka extended components).
6. Little Roku hacks.
7. View management.
8. Data scoping.
